## About WATERLINE

WATERLINE is an initiative aimed at creating a transformative and sustainable impact on water-related education, research, and innovation across Europe. Leveraging the quadruple helix model, WATERLINE seeks to establish a European Digital Water Higher Education Institution (HEI) Alliance. Our mission encompasses the development of research, educational, and entrepreneurship capacities, with a keen interest in exploring the potential of Extended Reality (XR) technologies.

## Our Vision

To pioneer innovation in digital water education and research, WATERLINE aspires to be at the forefront of developing XR applications that address critical water management challenges. Our goal is to foster an environment of collaboration and learning that transcends traditional boundaries, creating a sustainable future for water resources management.
